# Raspi-Init
This repo was made for my dad's raspberry pi 5. Lately we usually reinstall raspi os but it's boring to reinstall everything by hand so I've made this repo.

## Warning / Installation
This repo is not fully done yet so there are my instructions:
- make sure your user name is `equa`
- go into downloads folder by: `cd /home/equa/Downloads`
- clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/equa-tory/raspi-init`
- enter installation folder by: `cd raspi-init`
- make `setup` file executable by: `chmod +x setup.sh`
- run installation: `./setup.sh`

## Known issues
There are bugs that I know, and I know that i can fix them in future if I won't be lazy
- some folder creations, file copying and a bit more works only with `equa` user
- there is definetly better way to make this
